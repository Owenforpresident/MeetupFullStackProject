This was made using CRA, however, I built it in a seperare client_src folder so that I could it  run it on a seperate port from the loopback server during development so I can edit at the same time. When deploying, just put in a script that creates a build folder in the regular src folder and then tell the server where to look. 
This is just for convience. (make sure to have only one .git file through out the entirity of the project or you will have a bad time)
